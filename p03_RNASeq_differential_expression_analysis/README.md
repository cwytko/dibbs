## README

The ID attribute entered in the htseq-count tool should be the same as the ID in your .gff file

![ID_Attribute_dff](https://github.com/statonlab/dibbs/blob/master/p03_RNASeq_differential_expression_analysis/ID_Attribute_gff.png)

In this gff file, the ID attribute is __ID__. So replace __gene_Id__ with __ID__
