## Workflow testing results
I used the datasets from the RNASeq workshop for testing.
This workflow has been tested on ds, hs, plat datasets. It ran without any problem.
But it didn't get through when using the log dataset. Specifically, the tophat step didn't get through.

I tested this workflow with exactly the same datasets. It didn't get through. I downloaded this workflow from my account from the main galaxy server and import to the local galaxy instance installed in my local computer. It worked for all datasets. The main galaxy server is not very reliable.
